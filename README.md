# IPCV-IMAGE-COLORIZATION
THE CODE FOR IMAGE COLORIZATION USING cGAN IS PRESENT IN THE REPOSITORY. THE CODE FOR IMAGE COLORIZATION IS PRESENT IN THE DRIVE AND NOT IN THE REPO. BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE FILE.

BOTH MODELS WERE RUN IN GOOGLE COLAB,HENCE THE DATASET SHOULD MOUNTED ON DRIVE.

THE TRAINING DATASET IS PRESENT IN train/train_color FOLDER AND TEST DATASET IN test/test_color FOLDER.

FOR cGAN:-

UPDATE train_path and test_paths,checkpoints_dir AND log_dir VARIABLES IN CODE.

FOR AUTOENCODERS IN DRIVE:-

THE VARIABLES train_path,test_path,predictions.string in model.save,string in tf.keras.models.load_model HAS TO UPDATED ACCORDINGLY.

BOTH MODELS WERE RUN USING GPU,IT IS RECOMMENDED TO DO SO.
